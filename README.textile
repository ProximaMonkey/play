h1. Welcome to Play framework

Play framework makes it easier to build Web applications with Java. It is a clean alternative to bloated Enterprise Java stacks. It focuses on developer productivity and targets RESTful architectures. Play is a perfect companion to agile software development.

h2. Bing Ran local patches:

I have made a few patched that fix a few bugs and inconvenience

# simplified the error message in case of ActionNotFoundException.
# MemecachedImpl: clean keys with space and delegate to super class loader for primitive array types
# UrlEncodeParser: changed to use "_body" from "body" to avoid conflicts with user's body parameter
# NoRouteFoundException: added the action name in the error message.
# Invoker: synch the creation of the suspended invocations.
# Play: added a delay in detecting changes to avoid run the detection for very requests in a burst.
# PlayHandler: added keep-alive header to the http 1.0 request. 
# Wrapped the HotswapAgent in PlayAgent.jar to be used as the jvm agent instead of the whole play.jar. This way start script for apps can be simplified tot he point that I can regular Eclipse run/debug instead of using the remote debugging mode.

1. Install the latest version of Play framework and unzip it anywhere you want:

bc. unzip play-1.1.zip -d /opt/play-1.1

2. Add the **play** script to your PATH:

bc. export PATH=$PATH:/opt/play-1.1

3. Create a new Play application:

bc. play new /opt/myFirstApp

4. Run the created application:

bc. play run /opt/myFirstApp

5. Go to "localhost:9000/":http://localhost:9000 and you’ll see the welcome page.

6. Start developing your new application:

* "Your first application — the ‘Hello World’ tutorial":http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.1/firstapp
* "Tutorial — Play guide, a real world app step-by-step":http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.1/guide1
